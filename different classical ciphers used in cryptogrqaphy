Substitution ciphers are a fundamental class of encryption methods where each letter or symbol in the plaintext is replaced with another letter or symbol. Here are some common types of substitution ciphers:

 1. Caesar Cipher
-Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
 For example, a shift of 3 transforms A to D, B to E, etc.
- Example: 
  - Plaintext: HELLO
  - Ciphertext (shift 3): KHOOR

 2. Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a fixed corresponding letter from a random permutation of the alphabet. 
- Example: 
  - Plaintext: A B C D E F G
  - Ciphertext: Q W E R T Y U (A→Q, B→W, C→E, etc.)

 3. Vigenère Cipher
A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to dictate the shift for each letter of the plaintext.
Example: 
  - Plaintext: ATTACKATDAWN, Keyword: LEMON
  - Ciphertext: LXFOPVEFRNHR

4. Playfair Cipher
A digraph substitution cipher where pairs of letters are encrypted using a 5x5 matrix based on a keyword.

 5. Atbash Cipher
-  A monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by its reverse in the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.).
Example: 
  - Plaintext: HELLO
  - Ciphertext: SVOOL

 6. Beaufort Cipher
 A symmetrical substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts in the same way, using a keyword to determine shifts.

8. Keyword Cipher
A monoalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to form the substitution alphabet. The keyword is written out, followed by the remaining unused letters of the alphabet.
Example: Keyword: KEYWORD
  - Substitution Alphabet: K E Y W O R D A B C F G H I J L M N P Q S T U V X Z
  - Plaintext: ABCD
  - Ciphertext: KEYD

 9. Homophonic Substitution Cipher
Each letter in the plaintext can be replaced with multiple symbols or letters, reducing the effectiveness of frequency analysis.
- Example: 
  - A could be replaced by 1, 2, or 3, B by 4 or 5, etc.

10. Affine Cipher
 A type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to a number, transformed using a mathematical function, and then converted back to a letter.
